# 🚗 EV Market Analysis – India (2022–2024)

## 📊 Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Indian electric vehicle (EV) market from 2022 to 2024. Conducted as a self-initiated learning initiative during my time at Capgemini, the goal was to support strategic expansion decisions for AtliQ Motors, a leading EV manufacturer in North America. The analysis was inspired by Codebasics tutorials and performed using SQL.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
AtliQ Motors aims to expand its presence in India, where its market share is currently below 2%. To support this move, a detailed study of the Indian EV and hybrid vehicle market was conducted, focusing on sales trends, penetration rates, seasonal patterns, and growth metrics across states and manufacturers.
